# JHU Exploratory Data Analysis - Week 1 - Project Course

## Dataset

**Dataset:** Electric power consumption [20Mb]  

**Description:** Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.  

**Period of study:** from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02  

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:  

**Date:** Date in format dd/mm/yyyy  
**Time:** time in format hh:mm:ss  
**Global_active_power:** household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)  
**Global_reactive_power:** household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)  
**Voltage:** minute-averaged voltage (in volt)  
**Global_intensity:** household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)  
**Sub_metering_1:** energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).  
**Sub_metering_2:** energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.  
**Sub_metering_3:** energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.  

#### Scripts

**Plot1.R :** generate an histogram of the frequency distribution of the global active power in kilowatt. The output file is a PNG file  
**Plot2.R :** generate a plot of the frequency distribution of the global active power in kilowatt by day. The output file is a PNG file  
**Plot3.R :** generate a plot of the frequency distribution of the energy sub metering by day. The output file is a PNG file  
**Plot4.R :** generate 4 plots graphics  
  - frequency distribution of the global active power in kilowatt by day.  
  - frequency distribution of the Voltage by day.  
  - frequency distribution of the energy sub metering by day.  
  - frequency distribution of the global reactive power by day.
